      "content": "By tokenizing data assets and using smart contracts to manage access control, each transaction, which includes publishing, sale, exchange, and consumption of data services, is logged automatically and immutable on the distributed ledger. This creates a data audit trail for academia which allows research institutions to monitor the use of their assets and gain attribution for their work."
